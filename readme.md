# My personal QMK keymap for Planck Rev6 Drop keyboard, finetuned for MacOS.

A pretty basic main layer, including MacOS function keys and inverted t-shaped arrow cluster. Two layer keys (lower, raise) give access to a single extra layer, that has numbers and additional symbols such as parentheses, slashes and brackets.
Enter doubles as the right shift when held.
