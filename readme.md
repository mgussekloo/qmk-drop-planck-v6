# My personal QMK keymap for Planck Rev6 Drop keyboard, finetuned for MacOS.

There's a prety basic main layer, including MacOS function keys and inverted t-shaped arrow cluster. Two layer keys (lower, raise) give access to two extra layers; layer 1 has numbers and a few symbols I frequently use for programming, such as parentheses, slashes and brackets. Layer 2 is nearly identical, but has a few combos that would be hard to reach otherwise, such as (command + shift + number) and (command + shift + bracket).
